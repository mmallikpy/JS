40 days of Javascript task assignment
Day 10

1. What will be the output of the following code and why?
Ans: Bob

2. What is the mistake in the code below?

let total = 0; // Global, bad practice

function add(num) {
    total += num;
}

add(5);
add(10);
console.log(total);

Ans: Mistake is that in Global scope, we declare let instead of var. But in a video you recommend that don't use the var reason it's can overlap the variable name.

3. Create a function with a nested function and log a variable from the parent function.
Ans:-
function outer(){
  let name = 'Test name'
  function inner(){
    console.log(name)
  }
  inner()
}
outer()


4. Use a loop inside a function and declare a variable inside the loop. Can you access it outside?
Ans: No we can't access the variable.

5. Write a function that tries to access a variable declared inside another function.
Ans:
function a(){
  let varA = 'Function a'
}

function b(){
  let varB = 'Function b'
  console.log(varA)
}

b()

6. What will be the output and why?
Ans:
Output = Cannot access 'a' before initialization
Reason, we assign variable before console log.

7. Where is the age variable accessible?
Ans: B: Only inside showAge

8. What will be the output and explain the output?
Ans: output will "Hi". Reason Scope Chain, If it's not found the variable inside this Function then it's search upper Function

9. What will be the output and why?
Ans: output will "Inner". Reason Scope chain. It's in same Scope

10. What will be the output and why?
Ans: Output are -1, -2, Reason  count reduce the value 1 every time. Hear we call the function 2 times.
