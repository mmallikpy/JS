- `click`: Fires when a pointing device button (e.g., mouse button) is clicked.
- `dblclick`: Fires when a pointing device button is double-clicked.
- `mousedown`: Fires when a pointing device button is pressed.
- `mouseup`: Fires when a pointing device button is released.
- `mouseenter`: Fires when a pointing device is moved onto an element.
- `mouseleave`: Fires when a pointing device is moved off an element.
- `mousemove`: Fires when a pointing device is moved while over an element.
- `mouseover`: Fires when a pointing device is moved onto an element or one of its descendants.
- `mouseout`: Fires when a pointing device is moved off an element or one of its descendants.

### Drag Events
- `drag`: Fires when an element is being dragged.
- `dragstart`: Fires when the user starts dragging an element.
- `dragend`: Fires when a drag operation is ended.
- `dragenter`: Fires when a dragged element or text selection enters a valid drop target.
- `dragover`: Fires when a dragged element or text selection is being dragged over a valid drop target.

### Clipboard Events
- `copy`: Fires when the user copies text or other content.
- `cut`: Fires when the user cuts text or other content.

### Media Events
- `play`: Fires when media starts playing.

### Window Events
- `load`: Fires when the document has finished loading.

These are just some of the common event listeners available in the DOM. You can add event listeners to elements using the `addEventListener` method in JavaScript:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('event', function, useCapture);
```

For example, to handle a click event:

```javascript
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```
